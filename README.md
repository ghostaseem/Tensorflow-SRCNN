# Tensorflow-SRCNN

The excises that has been conduct:
1. To get and show the Ground Truth image
2. To get and show the low-resolution image
3. To get the input image into the SRCNN
4. To call SRCNN to super-resolve the input image
5. To get and show the output high-resolution image by SRCNN
6. To compute the PSNR of the high-resolution image against the Ground Truth
image
7. To get the high-resolution image with bicubic interpolation algorithm
(baseline result)
8. To compute the PSNR of the baseline result (Tip: use the python module:
skimage.meause.compare_psnr)
9. To compare the results of the two methods in terms of PSNR
